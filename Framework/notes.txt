any classes in our framework folder 
we do not have to require

we can also use a sub directory in framework 
    PSR-4 allows us to use sub folders in with name spaces

    

    1: first go to the file such as Router.php 
        and add the namespace Framework;
    2: now when we use this router we need to specify 
       we need to specify that namespace 
    3: then go to the file where we are useing ther Router 
       and type use Framework/Router 
    
    
    -: in Class declare namespace buy using namespace Framework
    -: then in every file that needs access
       type Framework\Database 
       type Framework\Router 
       etc

    -: this tells the file to use the Class Router in 
       the Framework folder
